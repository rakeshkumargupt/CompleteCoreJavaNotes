Polymorphism - Poly means many, morphs means form,

	having multiple forms.

it is the abilty to take multiple form for method of class, because of this we can have multiple behavior for the same function name.

It occurs in two ways:

1. Compile Time Polymorphism - it is also called early binding as it occurs during the compilation process.

It is provided using the concept of Method Overloading.

2. Run Time Polymorphism - it is also called late binding as it occurs during execution/runtime.


It is provided using the concept of Method Overriding.

Method Overloading - 

class calculator
{
int sum(int a,int b);
int sum(String a,String b);
}

sum(5,10);
sum("A","B");

Method Overloading - it is the process in which we can the function with the same name but different parameters in the same class.

We can overload a function as follows:

1. changing no. of parameters
	sum(int ,int), sum(int ,int , int )
2. changing the data type of parameters
	sum(int ,int) sum (String ,String)
3. changing the data type sequence
	sum(int ,string) sum(string ,int)

but we cannot overload a function by changing its return type.


Method Overriding: it is the case of inheritance in which the parent class method is overriden by its child class method if the method name and signature is same in both the class.

The child and the parent class must have the same method name and same signature for overriding.

Pointer are not type safe.

Method Overloading vs Method Overriding
1. Method overloading occurs in same class, while overrding must have two class

2. Method overloading signature must be different for two methods, in
overrding the signture must be same in parent and child class for overrding to occur.
