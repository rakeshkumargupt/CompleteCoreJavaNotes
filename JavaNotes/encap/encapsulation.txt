OOPS

Features of OOPS
1. class
2. object
3. Encapsulation

describe 3 pillars of OOPS
1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism

Encapsulation - it is the concept of data hiding within the class, so that it cannot accessed directly from outside the class.

In order to do so we use different access modifiers i.e. public, private, protected, default.

public - it has the global access within class, child class, outside class, outside package (folder / director)

scope: global, wider
security: very less / no security

protected - it has the access within class, child class, outside class, but not outside package (folder / director)

default - it has the access within class, child class in the same package, outside class in the same package, but not outside package (folder / director), default has less accessibility than protected.

private- it has the access only within class, but not in the child class, not outside class, not outside package (folder / director)

scope: very limited, norrow scope
security: very hight

class is like a family
