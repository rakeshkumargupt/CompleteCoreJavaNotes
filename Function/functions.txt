Function - is a set of instructions put together to perform a particular task. it encourages the resuability of code. It also provides the modularity of code.

It can be called anywhere in the program in the given scope.

in java function is generally referred as method.

function can be of the following types:

1. Built-in /library / Pre-defined function - These are provided by the language in form of some library.

2. Custom / User Defined function - these are created by user/programmer for the specific need i.e. calculating the leaves of employee, generating the monthly payroll for a department.

Signature of Function:

[Access Modifier] <return type> <function name>([parameters])
{
//body
} 
Access Modifier -public | private | protected | default
return type  - void | int | String | object
function name - any valid name
parameters



class ABC
{
int a;   //Data Member of class

void show() { } Member Function of Class 

}

Member = Data Member + Member Function

function vs. method - both are same.


java
class Employee 
{
int a; //variable
}

C#
class Employee 
{
int a; //Field
}

snippet-> code snippet

calculate_attendance(int id) { }
calculate_leaves(int id) { }
calculate_allowance(int id) { }

calculate_salary(int id) 
{
calculate_attendance(101);
calculate_leaves(101);
calculate_allowance(101);
}
leave_application(int id)
calculate_attendance(101);

nested function? when we call a function inside another function then it is called nested function.

sqrt(sum(10,2));
order of execution-> inner most function will be executed first.
