Arrays:  What is array - it is the collection of similary types of data elements i.e. homogenous data items, having contiguous memory blocks assigned.

Types of Arrays:
Index based array: every item is identified by a unique index / subscript

1. based upon dimension

	a. One Dimensional - 
	b. Multi Dimensional
	c. Jagged Array / non rectangular array - in this type of array we can have the flexi sized array based upon our need.

2. based upon memory allocation: 
	a. dynamic array
	b. static array

3. Key based array - in this type of array we use alphanumeric key rather than index, it is generally the key value pair type, the key must be unique and value can be duplicate.

ex. index based array
	country[0] = 9111111;
	country[1] =9222222;
	country[2] =933333;

ex. key based array
	country["IND_Number"] = 9111111;
	country["USA_Number"] =9222222;
	country["AUS_Number"] =933333;

it is called KVP - key value pair, and is generally used in collection


Declaring Array:

Syntax:

<data_type> <array_name>[];
<data_type> []<array_name>;

1. Two Step Declaration

	<data_type> <array_name>[];

		<array_name> = new <array_type>[];

2. One Step Declaration
	<data_type> <array_name> = new <array_type>[];

Note: Array is also an object in java.
