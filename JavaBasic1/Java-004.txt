Accepting data from user using CLA = Command Line Arguement, it is the most basic way of accepting the data from the user during the program.
it will collect all the data in the String args[] array,
the first element will be at 0 index of the array.

The agruments will be separated by white space.

All the arguments supplied by command line are stored in the string array so they are of String data type.

To handle other types we can use the type casting process.
i.e. 
Adding two numbers by accepting them from the command line.
