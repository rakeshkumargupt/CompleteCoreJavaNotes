Flow Control Statements in JAVA

The flow control statements are used to control the flow of execution in the program.

we can have following types of flow control statements : 

1. Conditional Statements : the conditional statement are used to evaluate a condition and based on that further action is performed.
we can have following type of conditional statements : 

a. single line if - 
	Syntax : 
		if( <condition>)
			statement

Note : no statement for else part


b. if else
Syntax : 
		if( <condition>)
			statement
		else
			statement

c. nested if : it is an if condition inside another if, the outer if is executed first and if it is true then the inner if will be checked and if both are true then the statement will execute.
Syntax : 
		if( <condition>) //outer if
			if(<condition>) //inner if
			statement
			else
			statement

d. if else if ladder : in case of multiple conditions we can have if else if ladder in which the if condition are executed one by one like a ladder, if first condition fails then the second will execute otherwise rest of the conditions will be bypassed.
Syntax : 
		if( <condition>)
			statement
		else if(<condition>)
			statement
		else if(<condition>)
			statement
		else
			statement
