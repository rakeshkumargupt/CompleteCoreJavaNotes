What is OOPS: It is problem solving methodology that enables you to decompose large program into smaller modules / units. The smallest unit of oops is a class /interface.

Advantages of OOPS:
1. Code Reusability
2. Easy Maintainence
3. Easy to Debug

Features:

1. class

	Class: What is a class? A class is like a blueprint or template for its object, it is a logical representation of some real world entity. It wraps the data and method of the entity.

What is Entity? it is name of person,place or things.

person {student,faculty,employee }
place {college_address,room }
things {table,furniture,computer,fan }

Entity has attributes and behaviour

student {rollno,name,course,email,address,mobile }
faculty {facultyid,name,qualification,types,salary }
table {size, height, color,company }
mobile_phone {sim,model, imei,battery

make_call();
send_sms();
charging();

}

syntax:

class <class_name>
{  //class scope
attributes;
behaviours;
}


class student
{
	int rollno;
	String name,course,email;
}
2. object - it is the physical representation of the class. 
it is an instance of the class. We can access the member of the class with the help of its object / reference. 

. (dot) symbol is a member access operator.

member = Data Member + Member Function /method

class member types
	a. instance member - that can accessed by object, non-			     static member
	b. class member - that are directly access by 			  classname.member_name, static member

member scope
	a. local scope
	b. class scope / global



3. encapsulation
4. inheritance - 
5. polymorphism
6. abstraction

coupling

1. loose coupling / de-coupling
2. tight coupling
