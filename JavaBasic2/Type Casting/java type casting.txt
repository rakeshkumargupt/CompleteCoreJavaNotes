Type Casting - ? Why it is required - in order to have compatibilty of the data in the given expression:

int i=5;
String str="10";

int result = i+str; //15
number = + math
String  + concatenate =  510

Automatic Type Promotion:

literals? it is the value assigned into a variable i.e

string literals =  always in  " " i.e. A = "hello";
char literals = in ' ' i.e. ch = 'A';
boolean literal = either true or false; b = false;
integer literals = whole number i.e. i = 5;
floating point literal = decimal precision i.e. i = 5.17;

primitive
number

boolean

reference class
user defined type

Employee

Autoboxing: java automatically handles the data storage between value type to reference type and vice-versa it called autoboxing.

Boxing is the process of converting from value type to reference type and Unboxing is the process of converting from reference type to value type.

Object - object is the based type of all the data types in java, it can store any kind of value or reference type.
